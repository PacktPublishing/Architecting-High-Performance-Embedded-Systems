# Chapter 6 - Designing circuits with KiCad

This chapter introduces the excellent open source KiCad electronics design and automation suite. Working in KiCad, you design a circuit with schematic diagrams and develop a corresponding printed circuit board layout. Youâ€™ll learn how to turn a circuit board design into a prototype at a very reasonable cost. The chapter includes example schematics from the oscilloscope circuit project you will assemble in the next chapter.

After completing this chapter, you will have downloaded and installed KiCad, learned how to create circuit schematics in KiCad, learned to develop circuit board layouts in KiCad, and you will have worked through portions of the circuit board design for the digital oscilloscope project.

We will cover the following topics in this chapter: 
* Introducing KiCad
* Basic KiCad procedures
* Developing the project schematic diagram
* Laying out the PCB
* Prototyping the circuit board
