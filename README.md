**Design and build high-performance real-time digital systems based on FPGAs and custom circuits**

## What is this book about?
Modern digital devices used in homes, cars, and wearables contain highly sophisticated computing capabilities composed of embedded systems that generate, receive, and process digital data streams at rates up to multiple gigabits per second. This book will show you how to use Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and high-speed digital circuit design to create your own cutting-edge digital systems. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the fundamentals of real-time embedded systems and sensors
* Discover the capabilities of FPGAs and how to use FPGA development tools
* Learn the principles of digital circuit design and PCB layout with KiCad
* Construct high-speed circuit board prototypes at low cost
* Design and develop high-performance algorithms for FPGAs
Develop robust, reliable, and efficient firmware in C
Thoroughly test and debug embedded device hardware and firmware
