# Architecting High Performance Embedded Systems

This book takes embedded system developers through the complete process of developing systems based on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), including the design of electronic circuits and the construction and debugging of prototype embedded devices.

Learn the fundamental concepts of real-time embedded systems. Learn to design, build, and debug high-performance FPGA-based IoT devices.

Using powerful free software tools, including Xilinx Vivado for FPGA development and the open source KiCad electronics design software suite, and using low-cost hardware components, this book leads readers through the system design, firmware development, hardware construction, and debugging processes to produce a working embedded device.

By the end of the book, you will understand the concepts underlying embedded systems and FPGAs and you will have constructed a high-performance digital oscilloscope from scratch.

This book is intended for software developers, IoT engineers, and anyone else seeking to understand the process of developing high-performance embedded systems. It covers the key aspects of real-time systems, hardware design, circuit board development, FPGA programming, firmware implementation, system debugging, and the effective use of FPGAs in real-time systems.
