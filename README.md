**Design and build high-performance real-time digital systems based on FPGAs and custom circuits**

## What is this book about?
Modern digital devices used in homes, cars, and wearables contain highly sophisticated computing capabilities composed of embedded systems that generate, receive, and process digital data streams at rates up to multiple gigabits per second. This book will show you how to use Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and high-speed digital circuit design to create your own cutting-edge digital systems. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the fundamentals of real-time embedded systems and sensors
* Discover the capabilities of FPGAs and how to use FPGA development tools
* Learn the principles of digital circuit design and PCB layout with KiCad
* Construct high-speed circuit board prototypes at low cost
* Design and develop high-performance algorithms for FPGAs
Develop robust, reliable, and efficient firmware in C
Thoroughly test and debug embedded device hardware and firmware

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
architecture BEHAVIORAL of FULL_ADDER is
begin
    S <= (A XOR B) XOR C_IN;
    C_OUT <= (A AND B) OR ((A XOR B) AND C_IN);
end architecture BEHAVIORAL;
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for software developers, IoT engineers, and anyone who wants to understand the process of developing high-performance embedded systems. Youâ€™ll also find this book useful if you want to learn about the fundamentals of FPGA development and all aspects of firmware development in C and C++. Familiarity with the C language, digital circuits, and electronic soldering is necessary to get started.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book.
