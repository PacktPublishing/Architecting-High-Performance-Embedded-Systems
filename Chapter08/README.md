# Chapter 8 - Bringing up the board for the first time

Having designed, constructed, cleaned, and inspected the printed circuit board, it is now time to apply power â€“ the infamous smoke test. This chapter leads you through the process of carefully providing first-time power to the board and checking basic circuit-level functionality. After passing those tests, it is time to attempt loading some simple algorithms to test the operation of the FPGA or processor. The chapter also discusses some ways to adapt the circuit if it turns out to not be functioning quite as intended..

After completing this chapter, you will have learned how to prepare the circuit for initial power application and how to test circuit components for proper operation. You will understand how to develop and execute simple test algorithms, and will understand how to modify and adapt the circuit in case of design problems.

We will cover the following topics in this chapter: 
* Preparing for power-up
* Checking basic circuit functionality
* Loading and running test algorithms
* Adapting the circuit in case of problems
* Adding FPGA logic and checking I/O signals
