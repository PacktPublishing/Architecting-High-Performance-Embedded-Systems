# Chapter 7 - Building high-performance digital circuits

This chapter presents the processes and techniques involved in assembling prototype high-performance digital circuits using surface-mount and through-hole electronic components. A recommended set of tools is identified, including a soldering station, a magnifier or microscope, and tweezers for handling tiny parts. The reflow soldering process is introduced, along with descriptions of some low-cost options for implementing a small-scale reflow capability.

Preparations for circuit assembly and the techniques of soldering by hand and with the reflow process are presented in a manner applicable to a wide variety of projects. After soldering is complete, the board must be cleaned and thoroughly inspected to ensure all intended connections are intact and that no unintended solder connections exist before moving on to the first application of power.

After completing this chapter, you will have learned the steps in assembling digital circuit boards. You will understand the tools and techniques required for circuit board assembly, and will understand the steps involved in preparation for soldering. You will have learned how to solder surface-mount and through-hole components to the circuit board by hand and by using a reflow system, and will know how to clean the assembled board and thoroughly inspect it.

We will cover the following topics in this chapter: 
* Circuit board assembly tools and procedures
* Preparing for assembly and placing parts
* Reflow soldering and hand soldering
* Post-assembly board cleaning and inspection
