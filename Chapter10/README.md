# Chapter 10 - Testing and Debugging the Embedded System

As the development of our embedded system nears completion, the time has arrived to conduct thorough testing in the context in which it will operate. This testing must address the entire expected range of environmental conditions and user inputs, including invalid inputs, to ensure proper operation under all conditions.

For each test, the system configuration and test execution procedures must be carefully recorded and any resulting behavioral anomalies noted in detail. If you don't have enough information to reliably repeat a test, it may be difficult or impossible to fix the underlying problem. The chapter concludes with a discussion of recommended debugging procedures and a summary of best practices for high-performance embedded system development.

After completing this chapter, you will understand how to efficiently and thoroughly test a complex embedded system. You will have learned appropriate procedures for running tests and recording test findings as well as techniques for effectively tracking down program bugs. You will understand how to develop a set of tests that evaluate all of the important system aspects and how to maintain a focus on the best practices of successful embedded system development.

We will cover the following topics in this chapter:
* Designing system-level tests
* Conducting tests and recording results
* Ensuring comprehensive test coverage
* Effective debugging techniques
* Summary of best practices for high-performance embedded system development
